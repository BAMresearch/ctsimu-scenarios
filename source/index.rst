This is the specification for a JSON-based file format to handle the parameters of a full industrial CT scan scenario, intended for describing virtual CT scenarios for simulations, as well as for documenting real CT scan geometries and acquisition parameters and their measurement uncertainties.

| Specification version |release|, released under the **Apache 2.0 license.**
| A |link-pre|\ |release|\ |link-post| of this specification is available.

**Example scenarios** and simulated projection images can be found on the specification's `Github repository <https://github.com/BAMresearch/ctsimu-scenarios>`__.
